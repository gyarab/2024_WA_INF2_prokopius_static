            <strong>The Skibidi Toilets</strong> (stylized as ΣΚΙΒΙΔΙ), (Romanized: SKIBIDI) are the titular main antagonists of the <strong>Skibidi Toilet</strong> series created by DaFuq!?Boom! on YouTube, and were the primary adversaries of The Alliance before teaming up with them to top the Astro Toilets.
Skibidi toilets are designed as an army of singing, mobilized toilets with <u>human heads</u> which can turn humans into Skibidi Toilet though unknown means. They often wield weapons and modifications, much like their former main adversaries, The Alliance.
They are responsible for numerous acts of aggression towards both their enemies and bystanders, as well as spreading the influence of the Parasitic Skibidi Toilet, which can be used to infect opponents and make them serve the Skibidi Toilets temporarily.
In recent episodes, the Toilets seem to be once again be falling down <sup>in</sup> <sub>the</sub> <i>war</i>, <mark>as they have lost their most powerful unit</mark>, being the Chief Scientist Skibidi Toilet Mech. In Episode 71, it was shown that most of them (along with the G-Man Skibidi Toilet, who seems to be their only leader since the Chief Scientist Skibidi Toilet is deceased) have decided to flee the war and go into hiding, with the Detainer Astro Toilet hunting them down, however, G-Toilet managed to severely damage the Detainer Astro Toilet in combat, but took massive damage in Episode 73 from the Titans.
